0. For each of the coding problems below:
   (a) Describe a greedy solution.
   (b) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
   (c) Define the DP subproblem 
   (d) Write the recurrence relations
   (e) Do not forget base cases
   (f) Analyze the space and time complexities
   1 a. Greedy Solution is you go to the item with the best reward to cost ratio and take it until you
    cannot fit any more, and then you try to fit the next best and so on. 
    b. The counter example is W = 4, Store = [(3,3),(2,1.75)]. Greedy will fill up on 3 and be done. 
    Smart will buy 2 2's and have more reward.
    c. The DP subproblem is finding the maximum value using items that don't exceed the weight.
    d. The reccurence relation is bag[w] = max(bag[w], bag[w - wi] + vi)
    e. The base case is bag[0] = 0
    f. The time complexity is O(n*W) because you go through W weights and have to evaluate n items. 
    The space complexity is O(W) for storing the best case for each subproblem.
    2 a. Greedy Solution is you go to the item with the best reward to cost ratio and take it until you
    cannot fit any more or the item limit is reached, and then you try to fit the next best and so on. 
    b. The counter example is W = 4, Store = [(3,3,1),(2,1.75,2)]. Greedy will fill up on 3 and be done. 
    Smart will buy 2 2's and have more reward.
    c. The DP subproblem is finding the maximum value using items that don't exceed the weight or their item limit.
    d. The reccurence relation is bag[w][i] = max of bag[w - j*wi][i-1] + j*vi where j is from 0 to Ci 
    e. The base case is bag[where w or i == 0] = 0
    f. the time complexity is O(W*n) and space complexity is O(W*n)

1. The time complexity is O(n*W) because you go through W weights and have to evaluate n items. 
    The space complexity is O(W) for storing the best case for each subproblem.

2. the time complexity is O(W*n) and space complexity is O(W*n)
