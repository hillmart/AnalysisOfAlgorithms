0. Because the values held in f(n) are increasing exponentially the runtime 
is not necessarily O(n). 

1. The complexity is O(n) because with bottom-up it just goes through each element,
with top-down and memoization it records the results so it only does each calculation
once.

2a. The complexity of this DP is O(n^2) because of the nested for-loop.
2b. The Catalan Numbers.

DEBRIEFING
0. What's your name?
Marty Hill
1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?
5
2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
moderate
3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
Malik helped me
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%-100%)? 
100%
5. Take a moment to reflect on your Quiz 2 performance,
   (make sure you understand all the problems that you got wrong),
   and what you plan to achieve in the Midterm.
I struggled most with analyzing complexities so I will make sure to understand 
those better for the midterm and also study the example code more closely. My 
goal for the midterm is 80%.
6. Any other comments?
Thank you to Malik for helping me past the end of his office hours! He really
helped me understand the concept and how to apply dynamic programming.
Also, I went back and did the bottom up for mis, but that file is now not my 
fastest time so idk if you can see the version I submitted that has only max_wis 
and max_wis2.
